1.eate a clone of the repo 
2.eate a mycode.py file and add the code there(it will save the csv file)
3. git add ,commit, push before initializing the dvc
4.p install dvc
5.w init the dvc (creates the .dvcignore, .dvc)
6.w  add "dvc remote add -d myremote s3"
7.w add the file you want to track using "dvc add <filename>/" dont forget the forward slash
when you run the above command it will generate the error saying the git already tracking the file so first stop the tracking with the git and then run the dvc add <filename>/ command

8.do git-commit-push to mark the this stage as a first stage data 
9. now change the mycode.py file to add the new row in the data ,then check the changes via the dvc status
10. commit and push the dvc and also the git
11. again change mycode.py file and save the 3rd version of the data and again do commit and push
